# module-18-challenge

## While doing the analysis I found a few interesting trends. Noticebaly, on my Male Vs Female Distance bar chart, female riders averaged longer trip durations despite being much less in number compared to male riders.

## Additionally, on page 1 of our story we can see average trip durations by age, it doesn't come as a surprise that duration peaked for younger riders compared to older ones. Riders born 1995 displayed the highest trip duration. At the time riders born after this year experienced a drop in duration time. This could possibly be due to being too young and inexperienced (opposite issue of riders that are too old who might be experiencing health issues, etc.) or some other factors. Note: The data is 10 years old (from 2013) so all ages should be taken into account while doing the analysis(example: riders who are 28 were 18 at the time of the data collection)







## Acknowledgement: I referenced the speed-run while working on this challenge but the analysis/readme is my own
